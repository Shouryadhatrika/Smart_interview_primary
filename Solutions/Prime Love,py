'''Prime Love 
Lisa and Joey love prime numbers that don't contain 0 and they should remain prime after removing digits from the beginning. For example, they adore 3797 since 797, 97, and 7 are also prime. Your job is to find out the number of primes not greater than N, meeting Lisa and Joey's criteria.

Input Format
The first line of input contains T - the number of test cases. It's followed by T lines, each line containing a single number - N.

Output Format
For each test case, print the number of primes not greater than N, that Lisa and Joey love, separated by a new line.

Constraints
10 points
1 <= T <= 103
1 <= N <= 103

40 points
1 <= T <= 104
1 <= N <= 104

100 points
1 <= T <= 106
1 <= N <= 106

Explanation

Example 1:
Primes in [1, 30] are {2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29}.
11, 19, and 29, after removing the leading digits, will not be prime. All other primes are loved by Lisa and Joey.'''
